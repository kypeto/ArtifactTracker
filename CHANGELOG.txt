1.0 - Initial release. Based on latest resource tracker (2013-07-15).

Below is the original Resource Tracker description. May not be accurate.

If you have Docker installed, it will place an icon in the Dock. If you do not
have Docker, it will place an icon somewhere in the topleft of the screen.

The icon is a silver diamond on a minimap style button. The button will
initially be gray, and can be moved around by dragging.

Once it is in place, RIGHT CLICK the button, and it will gain some color. At
this point, the configuration screen can be accessed by LEFT CLICKing the
button.

This will display the RT Config screen, which lists all Mining/Foraging node
types. Use the checkboxes to select which you are interested in seeing
notifications for. At the bottom of the config screen, is a dark red box,
showing an arrow, a resource and some text. Using the mousewheel on this red
section will change the size of the font used.

When the configuration screen is visible, there will also be another blue bar
shown, labelled 'Resource Tracker'. This is the anchor for where the alerts will
appear. This can be moved around by dragging the blue bar.

NOTE: The arrow indicator is the COMPASS DIRECTION of the node - not a
      direction relative to your heading.

The arrow will be green or red (red indicates that the node is significantly
above or below you)
